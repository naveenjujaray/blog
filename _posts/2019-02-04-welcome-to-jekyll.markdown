Imagine you and I are sitting at a place, where we find the blue sky filled with clouds, the cool breeze
echoing the chirping of birds and having a mind full of thoughts to talk.

Sounds cool, right! What do you think? But we may not have the facility to visit each other and have
time to spend in expressing our views.

Well anyway, we can meet at this virtual platform. This is my website where I share all my ideas,
thoughts, news, experiences and other awesome stuff with you. And remember it’s the effort in doing
anything that makes any difference.

Cheers! You are welcome to respond, add comments and suggestions. I’m eager to have your support in
this journey.

Sincerely

Keerthi Sree
