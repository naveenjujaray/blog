There is a resurgence of draconian State `blocking/slowdowns of Internet` in Turkey, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere, with Iraq at the time of writing passing the 104th hour of blackout due to ongoing protests `against government` corruption, Egypt having over `500` news/rights/etc websites known `blocked` and Turkey e.g. habitually ordering hundreds of State-takedowns monthly with `major knowledge` and `culture treasures` of `humankind` such as `Wikipedia` being completely `banned` for almost `900 days` now.

## These free of cost options have been verified with people IN current State censorship/blocking as working recently:

* [ProtonVPN] has a free of cost mode that should be more than enough for any average user and is motivated by anti-censorship. Works on `Linux/Windows/Android/Routers/MacOS/iPhone/iPad.`
* [RiseupVPN], the newish `Bitmask-based VPN` which was previously named Riseup Black.
* [Calyx VPN] is similar to RiseupVPN, with same technologies but `different addresses`, so may be useful if Riseup has already been blocked.
* [Tor Browser] Also other `Tor-based` solutions like [Tails] and [Whonix] of course, but Tor Browser is a good cross-platform start. Tor is however a `bit slow` and triggers so many CAPTCHAs that use may even become practically impossible.
* [WARP] the `new VPN` from `CloudFlare`. May be difficult for dictatorships to block, as CloudFlare is (unfortunately) a core component of extremely many major `commercial/government` web-based services nowadays.

## For local messaging when/if Internet Service Providers (ISPs) shut down networking completely:
* [Briar] has been shown to work.
* [FireChat] claims to fill a similar function, but I have not had it verified as working there, now.

## Instant-messaging tools with high level of general trust, but which require centralized infrastructure to work:
* [Signal] Works on most computers and phones, but uses mobile phone numbers as user identifiers, which are `easily traceable` by any State and relies on `centralized servers` for message delivery. `Open source`.
* [Wire] Like above, based on same protocol, but uses e-mail addresses as user identifiers and therefore is much more `difficult` to trace, as `temporary/dedicated e-mail` accounts can be used. Open source.
* [Wickr] Similar to above. Very `limited` open source.
* [Silence] Completely `SMS-based encryption`, as Signal was, developed from Signal’s old source code. Useful when there is no mobile data-traffic, but only SMS. Open source.

## Other Internet-blocking/slowdown circumvention tools that I haven’t verified to be working right now, but may be good to keep in mind if the previous stop working (Not an endorsement. Make sure to check anonymization, logging, State-collaboration, etc as needed before use):

* [Mada19 Outline] in `Arabic`
* [VPNBook]
* The “[cryptofree]” or “[cryptofree WireGuard]” by the generally well regarded cryptostorm.
* [Lantern]
* [Psiphon]
* [Hola]
  

As the `State` combines the `blockings/slowdowns` with arbitrary `physical searches of people` in the `streets` and in `homes`, wherein finding one of the above mentioned tools leads to arrest, it is probably a good idea to hide their presence.
`For Android,` the two first methods [here for example] may work well.

Documents, videos, software installers, etc can be hidden in `encrypted` container-files and then placing those files in some obscure place that would not likely be inspected during a regular search, such as in a different program’s data-directories and similar.
`Encrypted` container-files can be created and opened using [VeraCrypt] (almost all desktop/laptop computers) or [EDS] (Android).

Using well known functions like `“Samsung Secure Folder”` or similar from other major manufacturers is probably NOT a good idea, as they are well known enough to have had passwords demanded during arbitrary searches.

As a probably last resort, there is an analog modem number still up in Sweden, which I have not verified myself due to lack of hardware, but a modem answers and using it did work last I heard.
`Sweden modem phone number: +46708671911 (username “toto”, password “toto”)`

Two more analog modem phone numbers that I have not verified at all if they still work are:
`The Netherlands modem phone number: +31205350535 (username “xs4all”, password “xs4all”)`
`France modem phone number: +33172890150 (username “toto”, password “toto”)`

Last, to state the obvious:
Absolutely `do NOT rely on` `Facebook` (which is also e.g. `WhatsApp` and `Instagram`) for dictatorship-banned communications, as they have cooperated with dictatorships’ `“lawful court orders”` in the past leading to capture, torture and/or executions, at least in Syria therefore presumably also elsewhere and furthermore publicly admitted to being co-responsible for genocide and enabling imprisonment of people for being homosexual through silent automated `“interests”` categorization being used as court evidence.
Better platforms to consider are for example `Riseup’s` [Crabgrass], [Mastodon] and [PeerTube].
