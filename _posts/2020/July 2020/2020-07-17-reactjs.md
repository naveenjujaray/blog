## What Is React?
Do you remember how Facebook’s UI or it’s messenger looked a few years back? During that time you had to refresh or reload the entire page for new updates or messages repeatedly. But now it’s no longer required. Today, each time there is a new update or message, a notification will pop up. Clicking on that will then automatically refresh your page and show you the latest updates. So, how exactly does this happen? Well, this is the magic of ReactJS and in this blog, I am going to discuss what is React and why you should go for it.
## JavaScript Frameworks
_Javascript_ is a dynamic programming language which is widely used for developing web applications. It is very lightweight and is supported by most of the modern browsers. Moreover, JavaScript supports both object-oriented programming and procedural programming. Thus, it is used for creating web pages with a client-side script to interact with the user and make the web pages dynamic and robust.
JavaScript has many frameworks among which we can choose depending on our need. Below diagram shows some popular JavaScript frameworks.

Following are the major advantages provided by the JavaScript Frameworks:

1. **Efficiency:** With the use of pre-built patterns and functions, the development of the applications became easy. The projects which used to take months to develop can now be developed in very less time. This increased the efficiency as well as reduced the time and effort involved.
2. **Security:** As JavaScript is an open source community, its top frameworks have strong security arrangements. Frameworks are supported by these large communities in which, the members and the users can also act as testers. This increases the chances of detecting any kind of backdoor or bug present in the framework. Thus providing better security at less cost.
3. **Cost Reduction:** JavaScript Frameworks are free for public use as they are open source. So, when we develop a web application using these frameworks, the overall cost of the application is much lesser.

Because of all these advantages, JavaScript frameworks are used heavily for developing web-applications. They have already proved their potential over the past few years. Among them, the most popular ones are React and Angular. **“Even though React is young, it is giving a neck to neck competition to Angular”**.

So, through this blog, we’ll be learning all about ReactJS. But before understanding what is React, you need to understand why we need it in the first place.

## Why React?
There were so many JavaScript frameworks available in the market but still React came into the picture. Let’s dive little deeper and find out the reason why ReactJS was needed.

Here, the data is received from various sources like initial data, real-time data and user input data which is passed to the dispatcher. The dispatcher then forwards this data to the store, from where it ultimately comes to the view. Now, the view is the part where you or a user interact with the application. So, whatever you see on the browser as a web page is the view itself.

But, `what do you think happens at the back end of the frameworks using this traditional data flow?`

Each time new data is added or any data is updated at the back end, the browser reloads the web page and repeats the whole process again. Only after this, we can see the updated data on the view. But this traditional data flow has one major drawback, it uses the `DOM` (Document Object Model). DOM is an object that is created by the browser each time a web page is loaded which can dynamically add or remove the data at the back end. But each time any modifications were done a new DOM is created for the same page. This repeated creation of DOM results in unnecessary memory wastage and a decrease in applications performance.

Moreover, manipulating DOM was very expensive. Therefore, there was a search for new technology which could save us from this trouble. This is where ReactJS comes to our rescue. With ReactJS, you can divide your entire application into various independent components. ReactJS applications still used the same traditional data flow, but something changed at the back end. Below diagram shows exactly what was going on at the back end.

Now, each time any data is added or updated from the back end, ReactJS uses a new tactic to deal with it. Instead of reloading the entire page, what React does is, it just destroys the old view. Afterward, it renders the view components with updates or new data and then places the new view in place of the old one. As a solution to the memory wastage due to DOM, React introduced `Virtual DOM`. You might be curious about `what is this virtual DOM` and how it solves our problem? Don’t worry, I’ll be explaining that later in this blog in detail, but for now, let’s understand what is React.

## What Is React?
React is a component-based library which is used to develop `interactive UI`’s (User Interfaces). It is currently one of the most popular JavaScript front-end libraries which has a strong foundation and a large community supporting it. 

_`NOTE`: ReactJS is only a frontend library and not the whole framework, which deals with the **View** component of **MVC** (Model – **View** – Controller)._
