I"%<p>There is a resurgence of draconian State <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blocking/slowdowns of Internet</code> in Turkey, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere, with Iraq at the time of writing passing the 104th hour of blackout due to ongoing protests <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">against government</code> corruption, Egypt having over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">500</code> news/rights/etc websites known <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blocked</code> and Turkey e.g. habitually ordering hundreds of State-takedowns monthly with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">major knowledge</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">culture treasures</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">humankind</code> such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Wikipedia</code> being completely <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">banned</code> for almost <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">900 days</code> now.</p>

<h2 id="these-free-of-cost-options-have-been-verified-with-people-in-current-state-censorshipblocking-as-working-recently">These free of cost options have been verified with people IN current State censorship/blocking as working recently:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://protonvpn.com">ProtonVPN</a> has a free of cost mode that should be more than enough for any average user and is motivated by anti-censorship. Works on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Linux/Windows/Android/Routers/MacOS/iPhone/iPad.</code></li>
  <li><a href="https://riseup.net/en/vpn">RiseupVPN</a>, the newish <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bitmask-based VPN</code> which was previously named Riseup Black.</li>
  <li><a href="https://calyx.net">Calyx VPN</a> is similar to RiseupVPN, with same technologies but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">different addresses</code>, so may be useful if Riseup has already been blocked.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser</a> Also other <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tor-based</code> solutions like <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> and <a href="https://www.whonix.org">Whonix</a> of course, but Tor Browser is a good cross-platform start. Tor is however a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bit slow</code> and triggers so many CAPTCHAs that use may even become practically impossible.</li>
  <li><a href="https://warp.plus/1erv">WARP</a> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new VPN</code> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CloudFlare</code>. May be difficult for dictatorships to block, as CloudFlare is (unfortunately) a core component of extremely many major <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commercial/government</code> web-based services nowadays.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="for-local-messaging-whenif-internet-service-providers-isps-shut-down-networking-completely">For local messaging when/if Internet Service Providers (ISPs) shut down networking completely:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://briarproject.org/">Briar</a> has been shown to work.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.opengarden.com/firechat/">FireChat</a> claims to fill a similar function, but I have not had it verified as working there, now.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instant-messaging-tools-with-high-level-of-general-trust-but-which-require-centralized-infrastructure-to-work">Instant-messaging tools with high level of general trust, but which require centralized infrastructure to work:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> Works on most computers and phones, but uses mobile phone numbers as user identifiers, which are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">easily traceable</code> by any State and relies on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">centralized servers</code> for message delivery. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Open source</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://wire.com/">Wire</a> Like above, based on same protocol, but uses e-mail addresses as user identifiers and therefore is much more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">difficult</code> to trace, as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">temporary/dedicated e-mail</code> accounts can be used. Open source.</li>
  <li><a href="https://wickr.com/">Wickr</a> Similar to above. Very <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">limited</code> open source.</li>
  <li><a href="https://silence.im/">Silence</a> Completely <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SMS-based encryption</code>, as Signal was, developed from Signal’s old source code. Useful when there is no mobile data-traffic, but only SMS. Open source.</li>

Make sure to check anonymization, logging, State-collaboration, etc as needed before use):</h2>

  <li><a href="https://www.vpnbook.com/">VPNBook</a></li>
  <li>The “<a href="https://cryptostorm.is/cryptofree">cryptofree</a>” or “<a href="https://cryptostorm.is/wireguard">cryptofree WireGuard</a>” by the generally well regarded cryptostorm.</li>

<p>As the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">State</code> combines the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blockings/slowdowns</code> with arbitrary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">physical searches of people</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">streets</code> and in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">homes</code>, wherein finding one of the above mentioned tools leads to arrest, it is probably a good idea to hide their presence.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">For Android,</code> the two first methods <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqXxldVqUMg">here for example</a> may work well.</p>

<p>Documents, videos, software installers, etc can be hidden in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">encrypted</code> container-files and then placing those files in some obscure place that would not likely be inspected during a regular search, such as in a different program’s data-directories and similar.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Encrypted</code> container-files can be created and opened using <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html">VeraCrypt</a> (almost all desktop/laptop computers) or <a href="http://www.sovworks.com/">EDS</a> (Android).</p>

<p>Using well known functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">“Samsung Secure Folder”</code> or similar from other major manufacturers is probably NOT a good idea, as they are well known enough to have had passwords demanded during arbitrary searches.</p>

<p>As a probably last resort, there is an analog modem number still up in Sweden, which I have not verified myself due to lack of hardware, but a modem answers and using it did work last I heard.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sweden modem phone number: +46708671911 (username “toto”, password “toto”)</code></p>

<p>Two more analog modem phone numbers that I have not verified at all if they still work are:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The Netherlands modem phone number: +31205350535 (username “xs4all”, password “xs4all”)</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">France modem phone number: +33172890150 (username “toto”, password “toto”)</code></p>

<p>Last, to state the obvious:
Absolutely <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">do NOT rely on</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Facebook</code> (which is also e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WhatsApp</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Instagram</code>) for dictatorship-banned communications, as they have cooperated with dictatorships’ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">“lawful court orders”</code> in the past leading to capture, torture and/or executions, at least in Syria therefore presumably also elsewhere and furthermore publicly admitted to being co-responsible for genocide and enabling imprisonment of people for being homosexual through silent automated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">“interests”</code> categorization being used as court evidence.
Better platforms to consider are for example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Riseup’s</code> <a href="https://we.riseup.net/">Crabgrass</a>, <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>.</p>
