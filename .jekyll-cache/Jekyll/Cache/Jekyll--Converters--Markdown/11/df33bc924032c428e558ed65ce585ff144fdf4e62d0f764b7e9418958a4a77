I"i<p>I recently decided to start a blog. I had used Wordpress in the past, so I knew I could get my blog up and running quickly using Wordpress. I was also slightly familiar with Jekyll. Doing a google search and reading a few blog posts educated me on benefits of Jekyll and static sites in general. I explored Jekyll a little more and loved it immediately.</p>
