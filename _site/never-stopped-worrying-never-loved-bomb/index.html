    "title": "Current tools against state's Internet-blocking for censorship",
    "body": "2020/07/05 - There is a resurgence of draconian State blocking/slowdowns of Internet in Turkey, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere, with Iraq at the time of writing passing the 104th hour of blackout due to ongoing protests against government corruption, Egypt having over 500 news/rights/etc websites known blocked and Turkey e. g. habitually ordering hundreds of State-takedowns monthly with major knowledge and culture treasures of humankind such as Wikipedia being completely banned for almost 900 days now. These free of cost options have been verified with people IN current State censorship/blocking as working recently::  ProtonVPN has a free of cost mode that should be more than enough for any average user and is motivated by anti-censorship. Works on Linux/Windows/Android/Routers/MacOS/iPhone/iPad.  RiseupVPN, the newish Bitmask-based VPN which was previously named Riseup Black.  Calyx VPN is similar to RiseupVPN, with same technologies but different addresses, so may be useful if Riseup has already been blocked.  Tor Browser Also other Tor-based solutions like Tails and Whonix of course, but Tor Browser is a good cross-platform start. Tor is however a bit slow and triggers so many CAPTCHAs that use may even become practically impossible.  WARP the new VPN from CloudFlare. May be difficult for dictatorships to block, as CloudFlare is (unfortunately) a core component of extremely many major commercial/government web-based services nowadays. For local messaging when/if Internet Service Providers (ISPs) shut down networking completely::  Briar has been shown to work.  FireChat claims to fill a similar function, but I have not had it verified as working there, now. Instant-messaging tools with high level of general trust, but which require centralized infrastructure to work::  Signal Works on most computers and phones, but uses mobile phone numbers as user identifiers, which are easily traceable by any State and relies on centralized servers for message delivery. Open source.  Wire Like above, based on same protocol, but uses e-mail addresses as user identifiers and therefore is much more difficult to trace, as temporary/dedicated e-mail accounts can be used. Open source.  Wickr Similar to above. Very limited open source.  Silence Completely SMS-based encryption, as Signal was, developed from Signal’s old source code. Useful when there is no mobile data-traffic, but only SMS. Open source. Other Internet-blocking/slowdown circumvention tools that I haven’t verified to be working right now, but may be good to keep in mind if the previous stop working (Not an endorsement. Make sure to check anonymization, logging, State-collaboration, etc as needed before use)::  Mada19 Outline in Arabic VPNBook The “cryptofree” or “cryptofree WireGuard” by the generally well regarded cryptostorm.  Lantern Psiphon HolaAs the State combines the blockings/slowdowns with arbitrary physical searches of people in the streets and in homes, wherein finding one of the above mentioned tools leads to arrest, it is probably a good idea to hide their presence. For Android, the two first methods here for example may work well. Documents, videos, software installers, etc can be hidden in encrypted container-files and then placing those files in some obscure place that would not likely be inspected during a regular search, such as in a different program’s data-directories and similar. Encrypted container-files can be created and opened using VeraCrypt (almost all desktop/laptop computers) or EDS (Android). Using well known functions like “Samsung Secure Folder” or similar from other major manufacturers is probably NOT a good idea, as they are well known enough to have had passwords demanded during arbitrary searches. As a probably last resort, there is an analog modem number still up in Sweden, which I have not verified myself due to lack of hardware, but a modem answers and using it did work last I heard. Sweden modem phone number: +46708671911 (username “toto”, password “toto”) Two more analog modem phone numbers that I have not verified at all if they still work are:The Netherlands modem phone number: +31205350535 (username “xs4all”, password “xs4all”)France modem phone number: +33172890150 (username “toto”, password “toto”) Last, to state the obvious:Absolutely do NOT rely on Facebook (which is also e. g. WhatsApp and Instagram) for dictatorship-banned communications, as they have cooperated with dictatorships’ “lawful court orders” in the past leading to capture, torture and/or executions, at least in Syria therefore presumably also elsewhere and furthermore publicly admitted to being co-responsible for genocide and enabling imprisonment of people for being homosexual through silent automated “interests” categorization being used as court evidence.

    "body": "2020/06/30 - This post is a follow-up of my earlier post about building a jekyll site. In this post, I will describe a few things that I modified on my site. For example, the footer show site title twice, I add a _config. yml setting to show blog author name instead of one of the site titles. Add site description: The blog site that you deployed earlier (as described in the post referenced above) should look pretty good, but we can make a few quick improvements to make it look even better. Add a variable description to your _config. yml and set its value to a short description of your site. _config. yml{% highlight ruby %}description: This blog includes posts related to topic A, topic B and topic C. {% endhighlight %}Try in browser. The description now displays in footer. Modify title above list of posts: On the Home/Index page, the list of posts are preceded by a title “Posts”. You can change it to a different title. Suppose, you want the title to be “Latest Posts”. This is easily achieved by adding a variable to index. html’s front matter:{% highlight ruby %}—layout: homelist_title: “Latest Posts”—{% endhighlight %}Try in browser. The Home page displays “Latest Posts” as the title above list of posts. Add github, twitter and rss links to footer: Github, Twitter and RSS links can be added to footer by simply setting variables in _config. yml. The link to RSS feed is already displayed at the end of list of posts on the Home page. But adding a variable in _config. yml and setting it to just rss also adds a link in the footer. _config. yml{% highlight ruby %}github_username: your_github_usernametwitter_username: your_twitter_usernamerss: rss{% endhighlight %}Try in browser. Github, Twitter and RSS links are displayed nicely stacked in the footer. Modify footer to display blog author name: Now the setting that I mentioned at the beginning of this post - displaying blog author name in the footer, instead of displaying site title twice. The Minima theme displays the site title a second time, because it looks for site author variable and if the author variable is not present it uses title variable as default value. So, to make this changes, you can simply add author variable to _config. yml. {% highlight ruby %}author: “Blog Author”{% endhighlight %}Try in browser. Footer should now display blog author name instead of site title be displayed a second time. Google Analytics: You can add Google analytics to your site by adding the following setting to _config. yml:{% highlight ruby %}google_analytics: UA-XXXXXXXX-X{% endhighlight %} "

    "body": "2020/06/30 - After I started a blog, as described in this post, I felt it would be cool to convert the author name shown on top of each post to a link to the about page. This was a minor change, but it required me to customize minima theme’s post layout. I describe the steps that I used to customize minima’s post. html layout in this post. Customizing theme files: You can modify a jekyll theme’s functionality by copying a specific file from theme gem and then modifying it. Jekyll uses local files of the same name to override the theme behavior. In addition, the local folder name has to be identical to the folder name in gem where you copied the file from. Create a folder in your site root directory: Since you are modifying the post layout, you need create a copy of the file in your local site. You need the following steps: In the root directory of the site, create a _layouts directory: {% highlight ruby %}$ mkdir _layouts{% endhighlight %} Locate minima gem’s post. html on your computer: You need to determine where Ruby gems are stored on your computer. You can figure out Ruby gem folder location by running the command gem environment and looking for the value of INSTALLATION DIRECTORY field. The command output should look something like:{% highlight ruby %}$ gem environment RubyGems Environment: …  INSTALLATION DIRECTORY: /path/to/your/ruby/installation/lib/ruby/gems/2. 3. 0…{% endhighlight %}The minima gem files are located within this folder:{% highlight ruby %}$ ls -l /path/to/your/ruby/installation/lib/ruby/gems/2. 3. 0/gems/minima-2. 5. 0{% endhighlight %} The file you want to copy and modify is located within the _layouts folder: {% highlight ruby %}$ ls -l /path/to/your/ruby/installation/lib/ruby/gems/2. 3. 0/gems/minima-2. 5. 0/_layoutsdefault. htmlhome. htmlpage. htmlpost. html{% endhighlight %} An alternative way to figure out the location of gem files is by using the command bundle show minima. #Copy the gem post. html to your siteCopy _layouts/post. html from minima ruby gem folder into the local _layouts directory just created. Go to your site’s root directory and then run the following commands: {% highlight ruby %}$ cd _layouts$ cp /path/to/your/ruby/installation/lib/ruby/gems/2. 3. 0/gems/minima-2. 5. 0/_layouts/post. html . {% endhighlight %} Make author name a link: Open post. html in an editor and locate the line that you want to modify. The html that you want to modify is shown below: {% highlight ruby %}Naveen Jujaray{% endhighlight %} Add an anchor element around {{ page. author }} as follows: {% highlight ruby %}Naveen Jujaray{% endhighlight %}Try in browser. In the post, the author name should now be a link. Clicking on the author name should take you to the about page. "

    "title": "Build A Blog Using Jekyll And Deploy To Github Pages And Set Custom Domain",
    "body": "2020/06/29 - I recently decided to start a blog. I had used Wordpress in the past, so I knew I could get my blog up and running quickly using Wordpress. I was also slightly familiar with Jekyll. Doing a google search and reading a few blog posts educated me on benefits of Jekyll and static sites in general. I explored Jekyll a little more and loved it immediately. The first thing that appealed to me about Jekyll was how programmer-friendly it was. Creating a site using Jekyll felt very similar to a developer’s day-to-day tasks. Another thing that appealed to me was Jekyll’s integration with GitHub Pages. Finally, free hosting provided by GitHub Pages (along with the ability to set custom domains) tipped my decision towards using Jekyll. I have written this post to serve as a stand-alone tutorial, while also trying to keep it short. I briefly describe new terms and concepts as I introduce them, but do not go into much detail. Jekyll’s documentation is excellent and working through Quickstart and Step-by-Step Tutorial should provide you good background on Jekyll. Let’s get started Install Ruby Development Environment: You need Ruby development environment setup on your computer. Jekyll documentation provides the requirements list here. In addition, you also need bundler. You can install bundler by using the command gem install bundler. Install Jekyll: Jekyll is a ruby gem. Install it by running the following command in a terminal:{% highlight ruby %}$ gem install jekyll{% endhighlight %} Create a new directory for your site: On your computer, create a directory to hold your site: Create index. html in the new directory: {% highlight ruby %}$ cd my-site{% endhighlight %}Create index. html with some content, such as: index. html Serve the jekyll blog: In a terminal, run the following command{% highlight ruby %}$ jekyll serve{% endhighlight %} This command generates the site files and runs a local web server at http://localhost:4000. Install theme gem: You can use a theme to improve your site’s presentation. There is a wide selection of themes to choose from. You can get started with minima theme which is provided by Jekyll. You can install minima gem using the following command:{% highlight ruby %}$ gem install minima{% endhighlight %} Create Gemfile: Create a file Gemfile in the root directory. Gemfile is used to specify which gems your Jekyll site uses. Gemfile{% highlight ruby %}source ‘https://rubygems. org’gem ‘minima’{% endhighlight %} Create Jekyll config file and add theme: You also need to set the theme in Jekyll’s configuration file. Jekyll reads configuration from a file named _config. yml in your site’s root directory. Create _config. yml with the following contents: _config. yml{% highlight ruby %}theme: minima{% endhighlight %}After making any changes to _config. yml, you need to restart jekyll serve for Jekyll to pickup configuration changes. Even after restarting jekyll serve, you will notice no difference in your site’s rendering. You will fix this next. Update index. html to use a layout: In the previous section, you saw that the text of your index page rendered without any styling from the theme. This is happening because Jekyll is treating your index. html as a regular html file. You can tell Jekyll to use the theme’s home layout by adding the following to the top of your index. html:{% highlight ruby %}—layout: home—{% endhighlight %}This is called the front matter. Jekyll does additional processing on any file containing a front matter. Minima theme provides a home layout which is most suitable for a site’s index page. Among other things home layout adds a list of recent posts to the home page. Try in browser. The index page of the site now renders in theme. Add site title to config: With the site rendered in theme, it looks really good. Like most sites, you want your site to have a title too. The minima theme uses title variable’s value (if available) as title of your site. You can set title variable by adding the line title: MyAwesomeBlog to _config. yml. Your _config. yml should look like this now: {% highlight ruby %}theme: minimatitle: MyAwesomeBlog{% endhighlight %}Restart jekyll serve and refresh browser. You will notice that the value for title that you provided in _config. yml now becomes the title of your site. Create about page: Create an About page by creating a about. md file in the site’s root directory. about. md{% highlight ruby %}—layout: pagetitle: About—{% endhighlight %} About meThis page will contain information about me. This file uses the page layout provided by the theme. Try in browser. About link shows up in top bar. Jekyll automatically adds any html or markdown files that are in your root directory to navigation bar, using value of the variable title from the page’s front matter as link text. Create projects page: Add another page to your site. Create projects. md in the site’s root directory. projects. md{% highlight ruby %}—layout: pagetitle: Projects—{% endhighlight %} ProjectsProjects will be listed here. Try in browser. The navigation bar now shows Projects link too. Clicking on projects takes you to projects page. Ordering navigation items: With about and project pages added, the site is in good shape now. Suppose you want modify the order of items in the navigation bar with About appearing to the right of Projects. All top-level pages are added to navigation bar in alphabetical order. Reordering navigation items is easily done by using header_pages configuration setting. Add header_pages to configuration and set its value to a list of pages in the order you wish them to appear. _config. yml{% highlight ruby %}theme: minimatitle: MyAwesomeBlogheader_pages:  projects. md about. md{% endhighlight %}Try in browser. The About and Project items now appear in your preferred order. Add a blog post: Creating a blog post is as simple as creating a directory and a file within that directory. Create a folder called _posts in the root directory of your site. Create a markdown (or html) file with year, month and day prefixed to the filename. {% highlight ruby %}$ mkdir _posts$ cd _posts{% endhighlight %}Create a markdown file with year, month and day prefixed to the filename: 2018-09-12-my-first-post. md{% highlight ruby %}—layout: post—{% endhighlight %}This is the contents of this blog post. Notice that this file contains Jekyll front matter and sets the layout to post, which is another layout provided by minima theme. Try in browser. The site lists the post you just added. Clicking on the post title takes you to the post. Notice that the hyphen separated text portion of the file name becomes the title of the post. Also notice that a link to RSS feed is added. Adding author name to post: In the blog post, you will notice that there is no author name being displayed. Jekyll minima theme supports author name setting. It just needs author variable to have a value. You can set author variable in the front matter of your post. Since it is likely that all posts on your site are written just by you, it is simpler to set author once in _config. yml. Add the following to _config. yml:{% highlight ruby %}  scope: path: “”values: author: “Blog Author”{% endhighlight %}defaults is special Jekyll setting that allows you to set front matter defaults. path under scope specifies which files this rule applies to. A blank path means the rule applies to all files in the site. Restart jekyll serve and refresh browser page. The post now displays author name. Deploying to GitHub Pages: This section describes how to host your site on GitHub Pages. GitHub allows you to host one user-level site on github pages. The github pages site for your github account should be created in a repository with the name username. github. io, where username is your GitHub username.  create a repository on GitHub with the name username. github. io.  add the github-pages gem to Gemfile. This is a gem provided by GitHub to manage Jekyll and its dependencies. Read this for more details. Gemfile{% highlight ruby %}source ‘https://rubygems. org’gem ‘minima’gem “github-pages”, group: :jekyll_plugins{% endhighlight %}  commit and push to your repository.  after a couple of minutes you can point your browser to http://username. github. io and your should see your site. Using a custom domain: You can set a custom domain for your site you just deployed as follows:  purchase a domain name using service of your preference.  in the root directory of your blog site, create a file CNAME.  add the domain name as file’s contents. CNAME{% highlight ruby %}myawesomedomain. com{% endhighlight %}  commit and push the changes to your gitub repository.  to connect the domain name to your site, you need to update ALIAS, A or ANAME records with your domain register.  for example, GoDaddy uses A records. If you registered your domain using GoDaddy, you can use IP addresses listed in this article to set A records.  set the www subdomain to redirect to myawesomedomain. com by adding a CNAME record with your domain register. This is not to be confused with the CNAME file that you created earlier.  if GoDaddy is your domain register, no action needs to be taken. GoDaddy automatically sets the CNAME record. Add Disqus commenting: Comments are essential component of any site. minima supports Disqus commenting system. Comments can be enabled for your posts by setting a configuration parameter. There are steps to add comments to your site:  sign-up for Disqus Basic account.  on Disqus, add your site as organization (you will use myawesomedomain. com).  in your site’s _config. yml, enable Disqus commenting by adding the following: _config. yml{% highlight ruby %}disqus: shortname:  {% endhighlight %}commit and push changes to your github repository. After github pages regenerates the site in a few minutes, navigate to `myawesomedomain. com` in your browser. You should see Disqus comments displayed at bottom on your post page. Note that Disqus comments are not displayed when running the site locally using `jekyll serve`. Conclusion: This post described how you can deploy your personal blog to GitHub Pages hosted site. We used Jekyll site generator since that is the technology that GitHub Pages uses internally. We saw how easy and quick it was to get a basic site up and running. Creating a post was equally straight-forward. Finally, we applied a custom domain to our site. "

You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title. MARKUP Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

    "body": "2019/01/24 - There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example: "

If the existing directory isn’t empty, you can pass the –force option with jekyll new . –force.  jekyll new automatically initiates bundle install to install the dependencies required. (If you don’t want Bundler to install the gems, use jekyll new myblog --skip-bundle. ) By default, the Jekyll site installed by jekyll new uses a gem-based theme called Minima. With gem-based themes, some of the directories and files are stored in the theme-gem, hidden from your immediate view.  We recommend setting up Jekyll with a gem-based theme but if you want to start with a blank slate, use jekyll new myblog --blank To learn about other parameters you can include with jekyll new, type jekyll new --help.

    "body": "2019/01/18 - Bucharest’s history alternated periods of development and decline from the early settlements in antiquity until its consolidation as the national capital of Romania late in the 19th century. First mentioned as the “Citadel of București” in 1459, it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler. Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest: The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators (Phanariotes) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest. [19] The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire. Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu). Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by Caragea’s plague in 1813–14, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and Imperial Russia (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later, an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city. "

<p>In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble:</p>

<p>I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.</p>
