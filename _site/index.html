    "title": "The Magic Of Interactive UI With React",
    "body": "2020/07/17 - What Is React?: Do you remember how Facebook‚Äôs UI or it‚Äôs messenger looked a few years back? During that time you had to refresh or reload the entire page for new updates or messages repeatedly. But now it‚Äôs no longer required. Today, each time there is a new update or message, a notification will pop up. Clicking on that will then automatically refresh your page and show you the latest updates. So, how exactly does this happen? Well, this is the magic of ReactJS and in this blog, I am going to discuss what is React and why you should go for it. JavaScript Frameworks: Javascript is a dynamic programming language which is widely used for developing web applications. It is very lightweight and is supported by most of the modern browsers. Moreover, JavaScript supports both object-oriented programming and procedural programming. Thus, it is used for creating web pages with a client-side script to interact with the user and make the web pages dynamic and robust. JavaScript has many frameworks among which we can choose depending on our need. Below diagram shows some popular JavaScript frameworks.  Following are the major advantages provided by the JavaScript Frameworks:  Efficiency: With the use of pre-built patterns and functions, the development of the applications became easy. The projects which used to take months to develop can now be developed in very less time. This increased the efficiency as well as reduced the time and effort involved.  Security: As JavaScript is an open source community, its top frameworks have strong security arrangements. Frameworks are supported by these large communities in which, the members and the users can also act as testers. This increases the chances of detecting any kind of backdoor or bug present in the framework. Thus providing better security at less cost.  Cost Reduction: JavaScript Frameworks are free for public use as they are open source. So, when we develop a web application using these frameworks, the overall cost of the application is much lesser. Because of all these advantages, JavaScript frameworks are used heavily for developing web-applications. They have already proved their potential over the past few years. Among them, the most popular ones are React and Angular. ‚ÄúEven though React is young, it is giving a neck to neck competition to Angular‚Äù. So, through this blog, we‚Äôll be learning all about ReactJS. But before understanding what is React, you need to understand why we need it in the first place. Why React?: There were so many JavaScript frameworks available in the market but still React came into the picture. Let‚Äôs dive little deeper and find out the reason why ReactJS was needed. Here, the data is received from various sources like initial data, real-time data and user input data which is passed to the dispatcher. The dispatcher then forwards this data to the store, from where it ultimately comes to the view. Now, the view is the part where you or a user interact with the application. So, whatever you see on the browser as a web page is the view itself. But, what do you think happens at the back end of the frameworks using this traditional data flow? Each time new data is added or any data is updated at the back end, the browser reloads the web page and repeats the whole process again. Only after this, we can see the updated data on the view. But this traditional data flow has one major drawback, it uses the DOM (Document Object Model). DOM is an object that is created by the browser each time a web page is loaded which can dynamically add or remove the data at the back end. But each time any modifications were done a new DOM is created for the same page. This repeated creation of DOM results in unnecessary memory wastage and a decrease in applications performance. Moreover, manipulating DOM was very expensive. Therefore, there was a search for new technology which could save us from this trouble. This is where ReactJS comes to our rescue. With ReactJS, you can divide your entire application into various independent components. ReactJS applications still used the same traditional data flow, but something changed at the back end. Below diagram shows exactly what was going on at the back end. Now, each time any data is added or updated from the back end, ReactJS uses a new tactic to deal with it. Instead of reloading the entire page, what React does is, it just destroys the old view. Afterward, it renders the view components with updates or new data and then places the new view in place of the old one. As a solution to the memory wastage due to DOM, React introduced Virtual DOM. You might be curious about what is this virtual DOM and how it solves our problem? Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll be explaining that later in this blog in detail, but for now, let‚Äôs understand what is React. What Is React?: React is a component-based library which is used to develop interactive UI‚Äôs (User Interfaces). It is currently one of the most popular JavaScript front-end libraries which has a strong foundation and a large community supporting it. NOTE: ReactJS is only a frontend library and not the whole framework, which deals with the View component of MVC (Model ‚Äì View ‚Äì Controller). "

    "body": "2020/07/16 - What Is Gatsby JS?: Welcome! In this article we are going to learn about Gatsby JS, what it is and why you would use it. So let‚Äôs start with the question, ‚ÄúWhat is Gatsby?‚Äù  Put most simply, Gatsby is a static site generator. Now what does that mean?  What is a Static Site Generator?: The static site part of this means that what Gatsby will produce for us are static HTML files that we load up on to a server. Now this works differently than how a lot of websites work where you visit a website and it has to go query a database or do some programming on the server itself in order to serve your web pages. So Gatsby is going to break that convention and have all of the stuff already pre-configured ahead of time and just serve that up.  It‚Äôs important to point out that static sites do not mean not interactive or not dynamic. So, we can load JavaScript into the HTML files that Gatsby serves as well as make API calls do interactions and build incredibly rich and immersive sites even though they are static in their nature of just being HTML files served up without programming server-side languages running. So that‚Äôs the static side of things.  Gatsby is also a generator. This means that Gatsby is actually a tool we run on our computer most commonly, although you can run Gatsby on a server, and it is going to generate content for you. In the common setup that we‚Äôll practice here we run Gatsby locally on our computer when we‚Äôre building a site and then we generate out the final finished product that Gatsby will spit out, which is a Gatsby static site, and again this will include HTML CSS JavaScript images all the stuff that we need for our site to run, Gatsby will generate it for us so we want to think of Gatsby as a tool that will help us build a final product but we‚Äôre not just like in queueing and throwing Gatsby into an existing site necessarily. In order to do all of this generation Gatsby is going to use Node JS. Node will be running in a development environment on your computer itself. However the final sight when you ship a Gatsby sight live because it‚Äôs static it will not need Node JS on the server itself. It‚Äôs using node to help generate the files as part of its tooling system but the final result does not require node to run on the server side. Gatsby JS Uses GraphQL: One of the great things about Gatsby is that it‚Äôs going to use the GraphQL querying language to get data from anywhere. If you‚Äôre not familiar with GraphQL, it is an evolution of how to make API calls simpler and more efficient. And it‚Äôs a really great tool that you‚Äôre probably going to enjoy getting into if you don‚Äôt already know it.  The most exciting part of this is that we can get our data into a Gatsby site from anywhere! We could use markdown files, we can access databases, we could hook into common CMS‚Äôs like WordPress and other headless CMS, as well as even just a CSV file. Because we have node running in our development environment and we have this GraphQL language, we have a huge range of abilities of what we could do to pull data into Gatsby itself. This is important to remember that Gatsby is not going to handle our data for us rather it will get that data pulled into Gatsby and generate the site from that data. Gatsby Uses React for Templates: Gatsby also uses React and CSS which hopefully you‚Äôre familiar with. React is going to be used for all of the templates and CSS for the styling. So, GraphQL will pull in our data, React will take care of what the template should look like and the styling is CSS. Then finally everything will be exported out into that final, super fast static Gatsby site. Gatsby Has a Rich Plugin Ecosystem: I also want to mention that Gatsby is built with a plugin architecture and this is a great system. Because what we‚Äôre serving up is a static site how we go about interacting with JavaScript and other things can get a little complicated. So it‚Äôs really nice that we could pull this complex code out into plugins and we could rely on a huge ecosystem of other plug-in authors to do some of the heavy lifting with common things for us. This plugin architecture is a huge part of Gatsby and what makes it so popular and powerful. ‚ÄúWhat is Gatsby?‚Äù Review: So just to briefly review, Gatsby is a static site generator that uses GraphQL to get data, React for templating and it‚Äôs got a plugin architecture. So that is ‚ÄúWhat is Gatsby?‚Äù Why Use Gatsby?: Now let‚Äôs talk about ‚ÄúWhy Use Gatsby?‚Äù In one simple sentence, you use Gatsby for its speed security and improved developer experience.  Arguably one of the biggest gains that you get with Gatsby, because it is generating a static site, is going to be the speed. It is going to be way faster than many of the alternatives, even compared to cached sites using WordPress and things like that because that static site is really hard to beat in terms of its speed and performance.  Also because of the static nature and just shipping HTML files this is going to be inherently more secure. There isn‚Äôt a live database to hack or access. There is not user data that is going to be stored on the server with the Gatsby site. So even if somebody were to be able to hack the server itself they‚Äôre still only going to get access to HTML files and will be able to do far less damage than they could if they were getting access to for example a WordPress site or had access to the user data or purchasers credit card information and all that kind of stuff. So we‚Äôre gonna have huge security gains when we work with Gatsby.  Finally, the third major gain with Gatsby is improved developer experience. I‚Äôm really glad that this is something important in the developer community today. It can be really draining and annoying for developers to work with antiquated stacks. One of the nice things about working with Gatsby is that you have a modern development environment. The tooling is simple and robust. The languages are modern and clean. Overall it‚Äôs a really great environment to be working in. That extends also into the community of other developers. If you are a developer this should be super clear to you and exciting. If you‚Äôre not a developer and learning about Gatsby at a high level, remember that this is something you really need to value in your projects: the developers overall experience. Gatsby JS is Open Source with a Paid Team: The last thing to remember about all of this is that Gatsby has a solid team open-source community and great documentation. Gatsby is an open-source project which has some great wins in terms of its ability to grow and people contribute to it. Also it‚Äôs free! That‚Äôs no small thing. However, unlike some open-source communities, Gatsby also has a team of professional, paid people that are there to help the open-source project grow and flourish. This is a great thing if you‚Äôre considering investing in a technology that might not have the long term support you probably don‚Äôt have to worry about that with Gatsby. Gatsby Values Documentation: Additionally, there is great documentation and that is really helpful when working with a tool to know that you‚Äôll be supported in the documentation. The Gatsby team seems to take that seriously and do a great job with it. A Quick Review of Gatsby JS: So, all that said let‚Äôs just do a quick review here of everything that we‚Äôve learned:  Gatsby is a static site generator Under the hood it uses Node, GraphQL and React Its primary benefits are speed security and developer experience Gatsby has a stable and growing community of developers and plug-in authors"

    "title": "Why I'm using Surge and not GitHub Pages",
    "body": "2020/07/15 - what‚Äôs a ‚Äúsurge‚Äù exactly? ü§î: GitHub Pages is so prolific at this point it likely needs no introduction. Surge, on the other hand, is a much lower profile project. It accomplishes the same goal as GitHub Pages, allowing one to publish their static site on an accessible URL of whatever name they choose complete with an ‚Äúhttps. ‚Äù Where surge differs is in how that website gets put on the world wide web. Surge lets you get from 0 to published in the command line without any extra setup. Once you install the package, you can use their CLI in your project directory to whip up an account‚Ä¶ üëâ surge  Welcome to surge!  Please login or create an account by entering email and password:  email: jamesKPolk@napoleonofthestump. gov  password: enter your domain to deploy to‚Ä¶ domain: sitename. surge. shsurge. sh is totally free. You can use your custom domain if you own it. Looks easy, but where are my git hooks?: The beauty of GitHub Pages is it will simply track your master branch and rebuild / publish your site whenever it gets updated. Thankfully, surge offers the option to hook into pushes and commits with a little addition to your package. json. This snippet will do the trick for redeploying on push:  devDependencies : {  surge :  latest ,  git-scripts :  0. 2. 1  },   git : {      scripts : {  pre-push :  surge --project . /     --domain forgottenpresidents. surge. sh  }    }Neat. But what are the benefits exactly?: Surge offers a few niceties that GitHub Pages won‚Äôt out of the box. For one, you obviously don‚Äôt need to use GitHub to manage your version control, so you can use any custom solution you desire and still deploy with the same surge command. we deployed a simple project folder with a few html files: . /build   - index. html   - what_i_stand_for. html   - donate_now. html   - 200. htmlNotice our 200. html added at the bottom. This acts as a fallback to serve up whenever a given route is invalid. Assuming these are all the html files in our build, we know someone visiting, say, sitename. surge. sh/sendfanmail would get a 404 since that file doesn‚Äôt exist. However, since we have a 200. html, Surge knows to just serve up this page instead since it‚Äôs a fallback. This is more flexible than the traditional 404. html to catch errors since we sometimes don‚Äôt want certain paths to result in a 404, like a dynamic username in the URL that gets handled in JavaScript but should always route to the same base page. This makes routing a bit cleaner whether you‚Äôre using a library like React router or just tapping into the browser‚Äôs history API on your own, since we don‚Äôt have to deal with redirects anymore üéâ Okay I‚Äôm starting to see it. What are the limitations?: So Surge was built to be really good at doing a very specific task. If you have anything more than a static site or client side application, there‚Äôs sadly not much you can do with this tool. Any fancy backend you have would need to be deployed separately, or you can use the aforementioned Zeit Now to deploy everything in one place. Now is a much more flexible tool that‚Äôs quickly gaining traction, but I‚Äôve stayed loyal to Surge because of the routing niceties and lack of any necessary config files. Of course you should use whatever tool that works best in your workflow. But the next time you‚Äôre building v175 of your portfolio site, consider giving Surge a try üòä "

    "title": "How To Create A GitHub Profile README",
    "body": "2020/07/12 - GitHub recently released a feature that allows users to create a profile-level README to display prominently on their GitHub profile. This article walksthrough how to access this new feature. Why READMEs?The GitHub profile-level README feature allows more content than the profile bio, supports markdown which means you can play around with the content more visually (Did someone say GIFs!?) and the README is significantally more visible as it is placed above pinned repositories and takes up as much space above the fold of the webpage as you like. A solid README is a core-component of well-documented software and often encourages collaboration by sharing helpful context with contributors. In my opinion, a profile-level README seems like a great extension of a convention a lot of GitHub users are already familiar with. If you‚Äôre looking to make project-level READMEs more awesome and helpful check out matiassingers/awesome-readme for resources and examples of compelling READMEs. How do I create a profile README?The profile README is created by creating a new repository that‚Äôs the same name as your username. For example, my GitHub username is m0nica so I created a new repository with the name naveenjujaray. Note: at the time of this writing, in order to access the profile README feature, the letter-casing must match your GitHub username. If you already have a project in a repo-named username/username and are interested in setting up a profile-level README, then I recommend either re-naming that repository or re-purposing the existing project‚Äôs README based on what makes the most sense in your particular situation.    Create a new repository with the same name (including casing) as your GitHub username: https://github. com/new     Create a README. md file inside the new repo with content (text, GIFs, images, emojis, etc. )     Commit your fancy new README!      If you‚Äôre on GitHub‚Äôs web interface you can choose to commit directly to the repo‚Äôs main branch (i. e. , master or main) which will make it immediately visible on your profile.          Push changes to GitHub (if you made changes locally i. e. , on your computer and not github. com)  Fun READMEsThe GitHub README profiles are written in Markdown which means you aren‚Äôt just limited to texts and links, you can include GIFs and images.

These free of cost options have been verified with people IN current State censorship/blocking as working recently::  ProtonVPN has a free of cost mode that should be more than enough for any average user and is motivated by anti-censorship. Works on Linux/Windows/Android/Routers/MacOS/iPhone/iPad.  RiseupVPN, the newish Bitmask-based VPN which was previously named Riseup Black.  Calyx VPN is similar to RiseupVPN, with same technologies but different addresses, so may be useful if Riseup has already been blocked.  Tor Browser Also other Tor-based solutions like Tails and Whonix of course, but Tor Browser is a good cross-platform start. Tor is however a bit slow and triggers so many CAPTCHAs that use may even become practically impossible.  WARP the new VPN from CloudFlare.

Lantern Psiphon HolaAs the State combines the blockings/slowdowns with arbitrary physical searches of people in the streets and in homes, wherein finding one of the above mentioned tools leads to arrest, it is probably a good idea to hide their presence. For Android, the two first methods here for example may work well. Documents, videos, software installers, etc can be hidden in encrypted container-files and then placing those files in some obscure place that would not likely be inspected during a regular search, such as in a different program‚Äôs data-directories and similar. Encrypted container-files can be created and opened using VeraCrypt (almost all desktop/laptop computers) or EDS (Android). Using well known functions like ‚ÄúSamsung Secure Folder‚Äù or similar from other major manufacturers is probably NOT a good idea, as they are well known enough to have had passwords demanded during arbitrary searches.

If Git for Windows is already installed, make sure you can run git commands from the command prompt or PowerShell.       Get the Flutter SDK:  Download the following installation bundle to get the latest stable release of the Flutter SDK: For other release channels, and older builds, see the SDK archive page.  Extract the zip file and place the contained flutter in the desired installation location for the Flutter SDK (for example, C:\src\flutter; do not install Flutter in a directory like C:\Program Files\ that requires elevated privileges).  If you don‚Äôt want to install a fixed version of the installation bundle, you can skip steps 1 and 2. Instead, get the source code from the Flutter repo on GitHub, and change branches or tags as needed. For example:git clone https://github. com/flutter/flutter. git -b stableYou are now ready to run Flutter commands in the Flutter Console. Update your path: If you wish to run Flutter commands in the regular Windows console, take these steps to add Flutter to the PATH environment variable:  From the Start search bar, enter ‚Äòenv‚Äô and select Edit environment variables for your account.  Under User variables check if there is an entry called Path:     If the entry exists, append the full path to flutter\bin using ; as a separator from existing values.    If the entry doesn‚Äôt exist, create a new user variable named Path with the full path to flutter\bin as its value.    You have to close and reopen any existing console windows for these changes to take effect. Run flutter doctor: From a console window that has the Flutter directory in the path (see above), run the following command to see if there are any platform dependencies you need to complete the setup: C:\src\flutter&gt;flutter doctorThis command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation.

    "body": "2020/06/30 - This post is a follow-up of my earlier post about building a jekyll site. In this post, I will describe a few things that I modified on my site. For example, the footer show site title twice, I add a _config. yml setting to show blog author name instead of one of the site titles. Add site description: The blog site that you deployed earlier (as described in the post referenced above) should look pretty good, but we can make a few quick improvements to make it look even better. Add a variable description to your _config. yml and set its value to a short description of your site. _config. yml description: This blog includes posts related to topic A, topic B and topic C. Try in browser. The description now displays in footer. Modify title above list of posts: On the Home/Index page, the list of posts are preceded by a title ‚ÄúPosts‚Äù. You can change it to a different title. Suppose, you want the title to be ‚ÄúLatest Posts‚Äù. This is easily achieved by adding a variable to index. html‚Äôs front matter: ---layout: homelist_title:  Latest Posts ---Try in browser. The Home page displays ‚ÄúLatest Posts‚Äù as the title above list of posts. Add github, twitter and rss links to footer: Github, Twitter and RSS links can be added to footer by simply setting variables in _config. yml. The link to RSS feed is already displayed at the end of list of posts on the Home page. But adding a variable in _config. yml and setting it to just rss also adds a link in the footer. _config. yml github_username: your_github_usernametwitter_username: your_twitter_usernamerss: rssTry in browser. Github, Twitter and RSS links are displayed nicely stacked in the footer. Modify footer to display blog author name: Now the setting that I mentioned at the beginning of this post - displaying blog author name in the footer, instead of displaying site title twice. The Minima theme displays the site title a second time, because it looks for site author variable and if the author variable is not present it uses title variable as default value. So, to make this changes, you can simply add author variable to _config. yml. author:  Blog Author Try in browser. Footer should now display blog author name instead of site title be displayed a second time. Google Analytics: You can add Google analytics to your site by adding the following setting to _config. yml: google_analytics: UA-XXXXXXXX-X"

    "body": "2020/06/30 - After I started a blog, as described in this post, I felt it would be cool to convert the author name shown on top of each post to a link to the about page. This was a minor change, but it required me to customize minima theme‚Äôs post layout. I describe the steps that I used to customize minima‚Äôs post. html layout in this post. Customizing theme files: You can modify a jekyll theme‚Äôs functionality by copying a specific file from theme gem and then modifying it. Jekyll uses local files of the same name to override the theme behavior. In addition, the local folder name has to be identical to the folder name in gem where you copied the file from. Create a folder in your site root directory: Since you are modifying the post layout, you need create a copy of the file in your local site. You need the following steps: In the root directory of the site, create a _layouts directory: $ mkdir _layoutsLocate minima gem‚Äôs post. html on your computer: You need to determine where Ruby gems are stored on your computer. You can figure out Ruby gem folder location by running the command gem environment and looking for the value of INSTALLATION DIRECTORY field. The command output should look something like: $ gem environmentRubyGems Environment: . . .  - INSTALLATION DIRECTORY: /path/to/your/ruby/installation/lib/ruby/gems/2. 3. 0 . . . The minima gem files are located within this folder: $ ls -l /path/to/your/ruby/installation/lib/ruby/gems/2. 3. 0/gems/minima-2. 5. 0The file you want to copy and modify is located within the _layouts folder: $ ls -l /path/to/your/ruby/installation/lib/ruby/gems/2. 3. 0/gems/minima-2. 5. 0/_layoutsdefault. htmlhome. htmlpage. html&lt;b&gt;post. html&lt;/b&gt;An alternative way to figure out the location of gem files is by using the command bundle show minima. #Copy the gem post. html to your siteCopy _layouts/post. html from minima ruby gem folder into the local _layouts directory just created. Go to your site‚Äôs root directory and then run the following commands: $ cd _layouts$ cp /path/to/your/ruby/installation/lib/ruby/gems/2. 3. 0/gems/minima-2. 5. 0/_layouts/post. html . Make author name a link: Open post. html in an editor and locate the line that you want to modify. The html that you want to modify is shown below: &lt;span itemprop= author  itemscope itemtype= http://schema. org/Person &gt;&lt;span class= p-author h-card  itemprop= name &gt;Naveen Jujaray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Add an anchor element around Naveen Jujaray as follows: &lt;span itemprop= author  itemscope itemtype= http://schema. org/Person &gt;&lt;span class= p-author h-card  itemprop= name &gt;&lt;a href= /about. html &gt;Naveen Jujaray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Try in browser. In the post, the author name should now be a link. Clicking on the author name should take you to the about page. "

    "title": "Build A Blog Using Jekyll And Deploy To Github Pages And Set Custom Domain",
    "body": "2020/06/29 - I recently decided to start a blog. I had used Wordpress in the past, so I knew I could get my blog up and running quickly using Wordpress. I was also slightly familiar with Jekyll. Doing a google search and reading a few blog posts educated me on benefits of Jekyll and static sites in general. I explored Jekyll a little more and loved it immediately. The first thing that appealed to me about Jekyll was how programmer-friendly it was. Creating a site using Jekyll felt very similar to a developer‚Äôs day-to-day tasks. Another thing that appealed to me was Jekyll‚Äôs integration with GitHub Pages. Finally, free hosting provided by GitHub Pages (along with the ability to set custom domains) tipped my decision towards using Jekyll. I have written this post to serve as a stand-alone tutorial, while also trying to keep it short. I briefly describe new terms and concepts as I introduce them, but do not go into much detail. Jekyll‚Äôs documentation is excellent and working through Quickstart and Step-by-Step Tutorial should provide you good background on Jekyll. Let‚Äôs get started Install Ruby Development Environment: You need Ruby development environment setup on your computer. Jekyll documentation provides the requirements list here. In addition, you also need bundler. You can install bundler by using the command gem install bundler. Install Jekyll: Jekyll is a ruby gem. Install it by running the following command in a terminal: $ gem install jekyllCreate a new directory for your site: On your computer, create a directory to hold your site: Create index. html in the new directory: $ cd my-siteCreate index. html with some content, such as: index. html Serve the jekyll blog: In a terminal, run the following command $ jekyll serveThis command generates the site files and runs a local web server at http://localhost:4000. Install theme gem: You can use a theme to improve your site‚Äôs presentation. There is a wide selection of themes to choose from. You can get started with minima theme which is provided by Jekyll. You can install minima gem using the following command: $ gem install minimaCreate Gemfile: Create a file Gemfile in the root directory. Gemfile is used to specify which gems your Jekyll site uses. Gemfile source 'https://rubygems. org'gem 'minima'Create Jekyll config file and add theme: You also need to set the theme in Jekyll‚Äôs configuration file. Jekyll reads configuration from a file named _config. yml in your site‚Äôs root directory. Create _config. yml with the following contents: _config. yml theme: minimaAfter making any changes to _config. yml, you need to restart jekyll serve for Jekyll to pickup configuration changes. Even after restarting jekyll serve, you will notice no difference in your site‚Äôs rendering. You will fix this next. Update index. html to use a layout: In the previous section, you saw that the text of your index page rendered without any styling from the theme. This is happening because Jekyll is treating your index. html as a regular html file. You can tell Jekyll to use the theme‚Äôs home layout by adding the following to the top of your index. html: ---layout: home---This is called the front matter. Jekyll does additional processing on any file containing a front matter. Minima theme provides a home layout which is most suitable for a site‚Äôs index page. Among other things home layout adds a list of recent posts to the home page. Try in browser. The index page of the site now renders in theme. Add site title to config: With the site rendered in theme, it looks really good. Like most sites, you want your site to have a title too. The minima theme uses title variable‚Äôs value (if available) as title of your site. You can set title variable by adding the line title: MyAwesomeBlog to _config. yml. Your _config. yml should look like this now: theme: minimatitle: MyAwesomeBlogRestart jekyll serve and refresh browser. You will notice that the value for title that you provided in _config. yml now becomes the title of your site. Create about page: Create an About page by creating a about. md file in the site‚Äôs root directory. about. md ---layout: pagetitle: About---About meThis page will contain information about me. This file uses the page layout provided by the theme. Try in browser. About link shows up in top bar. Jekyll automatically adds any html or markdown files that are in your root directory to navigation bar, using value of the variable title from the page‚Äôs front matter as link text. Create projects page: Add another page to your site. Create projects. md in the site‚Äôs root directory. projects. md ---layout: pagetitle: Projects---ProjectsProjects will be listed here. Try in browser. The navigation bar now shows Projects link too. Clicking on projects takes you to projects page. Ordering navigation items: With about and project pages added, the site is in good shape now. Suppose you want modify the order of items in the navigation bar with About appearing to the right of Projects. All top-level pages are added to navigation bar in alphabetical order. Reordering navigation items is easily done by using header_pages configuration setting. Add header_pages to configuration and set its value to a list of pages in the order you wish them to appear. _config. yml theme: minimatitle: MyAwesomeBlogheader_pages: - projects. md - about. mdTry in browser. The About and Project items now appear in your preferred order. Add a blog post: Creating a blog post is as simple as creating a directory and a file within that directory. Create a folder called _posts in the root directory of your site. Create a markdown (or html) file with year, month and day prefixed to the filename. $ mkdir _posts$ cd _postsCreate a markdown file with year, month and day prefixed to the filename: 2018-09-12-my-first-post. md ---layout: post---This is the contents of this blog post. Notice that this file contains Jekyll front matter and sets the layout to post, which is another layout provided by minima theme. Try in browser. The site lists the post you just added. Clicking on the post title takes you to the post. Notice that the hyphen separated text portion of the file name becomes the title of the post. Also notice that a link to RSS feed is added. Adding author name to post: In the blog post, you will notice that there is no author name being displayed. Jekyll minima theme supports author name setting. It just needs author variable to have a value. You can set author variable in the front matter of your post. Since it is likely that all posts on your site are written just by you, it is simpler to set author once in _config. yml. Add the following to _config. yml:  - scope:   path:     values:   author:  Blog Author defaults is special Jekyll setting that allows you to set front matter defaults. path under scope specifies which files this rule applies to. A blank path means the rule applies to all files in the site. Restart jekyll serve and refresh browser page. The post now displays author name. Deploying to GitHub Pages: This section describes how to host your site on GitHub Pages. GitHub allows you to host one user-level site on github pages. The github pages site for your github account should be created in a repository with the name username. github. io, where username is your GitHub username.  create a repository on GitHub with the name username. github. io.  add the github-pages gem to Gemfile. This is a gem provided by GitHub to manage Jekyll and its dependencies. Read this for more details. Gemfile source 'https://rubygems. org'gem 'minima'gem  github-pages , group: :jekyll_plugins commit and push to your repository.  after a couple of minutes you can point your browser to http://username. github. io and your should see your site. Using a custom domain: You can set a custom domain for your site you just deployed as follows:  purchase a domain name using service of your preference.  in the root directory of your blog site, create a file CNAME.  add the domain name as file‚Äôs contents. CNAME myawesomedomain. com commit and push the changes to your gitub repository.  to connect the domain name to your site, you need to update ALIAS, A or ANAME records with your domain register.  for example, GoDaddy uses A records. If you registered your domain using GoDaddy, you can use IP addresses listed in this article to set A records.  set the www subdomain to redirect to myawesomedomain. com by adding a CNAME record with your domain register. This is not to be confused with the CNAME file that you created earlier.  if GoDaddy is your domain register, no action needs to be taken. GoDaddy automatically sets the CNAME record. Add Disqus commenting: Comments are essential component of any site. minima supports Disqus commenting system. Comments can be enabled for your posts by setting a configuration parameter. There are steps to add comments to your site:  sign-up for Disqus Basic account.  on Disqus, add your site as organization (you will use myawesomedomain. com).  in your site‚Äôs _config. yml, enable Disqus commenting by adding the following: _config. ymldisqus: shortname: &lt;site-shortname-from-disqus&gt; commit and push changes to your github repository. After github pages regenerates the site in a few minutes, navigate to myawesomedomain. com in your browser. You should see Disqus comments displayed at bottom on your post page. Note that Disqus comments are not displayed when running the site locally using jekyll serve. Conclusion: This post described how you can deploy your personal blog to GitHub Pages hosted site. We used Jekyll site generator since that is the technology that GitHub Pages uses internally. We saw how easy and quick it was to get a basic site up and running. Creating a post was equally straight-forward. Finally, we applied a custom domain to our site. "

You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title. MARKUP Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
